Virtual Mouse

**Overview:**
The Virtual Mouse project leverages computer vision and machine learning techniques to enable hands-free control of your computer's cursor. Using your webcam, it tracks hand movements and gestures to simulate mouse actions, providing an innovative and accessible way to interact with your system.

**Features**
Hand Gesture Recognition: Recognizes a variety of hand gestures to perform different mouse actions (click, double-click, right-click, scroll).
Cursor Control: Smooth and responsive cursor control based on hand movement.
Customization: Configurable sensitivity and gesture mappings to suit your needs.
Cross-Platform: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

**Technologies Used**
OpenCV: For real-time computer vision.
Mediapipe: For robust hand tracking and gesture recognition.
Python: Core programming language for development.
PyAutoGUI: To simulate mouse and keyboard actions.
